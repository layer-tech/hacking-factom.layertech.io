# Introduction

The FactomÂ® protocol is an open source data integrity protocol built by a coalition of technology companies that extends the security of blockchain to any type of data. Factomd is the software that implements that protocol.

Factomd is written in Go. It is a large and complex codebase. This guide is intended to give new developers some traction in learning Factomd.

> Short version: Factomd connects to other instances of Factomd around the world to trade information so each node can follow along as new data is added to the Factom blockchain, some nodes are special and have extra tasks, but it is mostly about moving data around a peer-to-peer network and reaching consensus about that data.
