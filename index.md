### Getting Started

This guide is intended for people interested in learning to make contributions to the Factom ecosystem, either to the core codebase or not, and are new to the community. This guide will take a comprehensive approach and offer information to explain how the factom core works, both in some of the smaller details and the bigger picture. We will be following something akin to user stories to ensure context is provided for the packages discussed.

You can jump right in and start reading. Also, be sure to fork a copy of [`factomd`](https://github.com/FactomProject/factomd) to read alongside.
